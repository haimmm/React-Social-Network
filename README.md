# Social Network
[DEMO](https://haim-social-network.netlify.app)

This is my second react project and also instructed by my bootcamp class. \
Currently it includes login, register, profile settings and main page with posts. \
For backend I used firebase.

**I learned a lot along this project** \
First of all I didn't know how to use firebase and surfing through big api and find everything I need wasn't easy task.\
Worst feeling was when I search for something, just to find out it costs money or just not possible.\
In the other hand google saves you a lot of time and gives you running server with authtentication and db ready to use.


I also learned more common react tools such as context API so I can easily access the autentication system from all components, \
and also react router which gives multi page effet.


I know this project still lacks a lot of things but I focus quantity (more projects) for now. \
I plan to improve the design and add more functionalities later.
I do wanna imprive the search engine, implement like system and friends connections (currently everyone's posts updated on everyone's wall).
